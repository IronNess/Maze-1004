Moewze was created as a Single Webpage application game featuring JavaScript, CSS and HTML components. The main player visualises a cat, who has a goal of collecting interactive elements within the maze and reaching its final destination of a bowl full of cat food. With score and difficulty level, it is a simple but expansive game.
